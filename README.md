# Culture Credit App

TThe Culture Credit app is a mobile application created for use by Delaware State Universityâ€™s College of Agriculture, Science, and Technology (CAST). The idea for Culture Credit originated with the faculty of Computer and Information Sciences, now part of the Division of Physics, Engineering, and Computer Science (PEMaCS). It was inspired by the desire to encourage students to attend scientific and professional development talks, workshops, and seminars, and to foster a mindset of lifelong learning.

CAST students use the app to record attendance at approved events directly from their devices. The credits they earn can then be applied toward additional points at the end of the semester. Instructors participate by voluntarily registering their name and email in the app and including their specific Culture Credit requirements in their course syllabus. Students can then submit their earned credits to the appropriate instructor.

The application, which includes both mobile and administrative components, was originally developed as a Senior Capstone project by **Sameer Patel** and **Jerry Benn**.
